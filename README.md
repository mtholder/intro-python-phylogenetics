### Motivating project

#### Phylogenetics
MTH is a working on the [Open Tree of Life project](http://tree.opentreeoflife.org) which aims
to summarize what we know about the phylogenetic relationships of Life on Earth.
"Phylogenetic relationships" describe which species are more closely related to other
    species where "more closely related" is equivalent to "having a more recent
    ancestral species in common."
The simplest phylogenetic statement is one about three species.
For example: "Humans and chimps are more closely related to each other that they are to
gorillas."
That statement means that the most recent common ancestor of humans and gorillas was a 
species that lived earlier than the most recent common ancestor of humans and chimps.

Frequently we depict these relationships in a tree. See for example, this:
