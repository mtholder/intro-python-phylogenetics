# Prerequisites

## Python
Things will go most smoothly if participants have the tools needed edit and run Python 3 code on their
laptop when they show up.

### Using terminal + text editor
For most people, editing and running Python this will mean being able to:

  1. launch a terminal session. See the discussion for your platform on https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html

  2. launch a text editor (not a word processor). See [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for multiple platforms or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows.

  3. run the Python 3 interpreter. See [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Integrated development environment
Alternatively, you may choose to use a tool that edits text and lets you run python from within the same application.
Options here include:

  * the free (but not terribly sophisticated) IDLE IDE that comes with many Python distributions.

  * [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) which has a free option for students and teachers.

  * the [eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) with the python development support installed.


## Additional tools

Regardless of how you run python, it will also be useful to have
  * [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
  * [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools)
  * The [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) command-line tool for installing python packages.
